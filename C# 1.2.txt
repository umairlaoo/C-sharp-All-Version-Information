Sure, here are the major features of C# 1.2:

* **Automatic disposal of IDisposable objects in foreach loops:** In C# 1.0, the code generated in a foreach loop did not call the Dispose method on IDisposable objects. This could lead to memory leaks if the objects were not manually disposed of. In C# 1.2, the code generated in a foreach loop now calls the Dispose method on IDisposable objects, if the objects implement that interface.
* **Unicode support:** C# 1.2 added support for Unicode characters. This allowed C# programs to be written in any language that uses Unicode characters.
* **Other minor improvements:** C# 1.2 also included a number of other minor improvements, such as:
    * Support for the `using` statement to automatically dispose of IDisposable objects.
    * Improved error messages.
    * Support for the `dynamic` keyword to create dynamic objects.

These are just some of the major features of C# 1.2. C# has continued to evolve over the years, and it now has many more features. However, these are the basic features that make C# a powerful and versatile programming language.

I hope this helps!
