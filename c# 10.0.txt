As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, C# 10.0 had not been released yet. Therefore, I cannot provide you with the specific features introduced in C# 10.0 or any updates that might have occurred after September 2021.

C# version updates usually come with new language features, performance improvements, and enhancements to the developer experience. To get the most accurate and up-to-date information about the features of C# 10.0, I recommend checking the official Microsoft documentation or other reliable sources that provide information on the latest developments in the C# programming language.
