Sure, here are some of the major features of C# 11.0:

* **Raw string literals:** Raw string literals allow you to write strings that contain any character, including newline characters. This can be useful for writing strings that contain formatted text or that need to be parsed as XML or JSON.
* **List patterns:** List patterns allow you to match against lists of values. This can be useful for pattern matching against collections of data.
* **File-local types:** File-local types allow you to create types that are only visible in the file in which they are declared. This can be useful for creating utility types or types that are only used in a specific context.
* **Required members:** Required members allow you to specify that certain members of a class must be implemented by subclasses. This can help to ensure that subclasses are properly implemented.
* **Auto-default structs:** Auto-default structs allow you to create structs that have default values for all of their members. This can make your code more concise and readable.
* **Pattern match Span<char> on a constant string:** You can now pattern match Span<char> on a constant string. This can be useful for matching against strings that are known at compile time.
* **Extended nameof scope:** The nameof operator can now be used to get the name of a field or property that is declared in an inner type. This can be useful for debugging and tracing.
* **Numeric IntPtr:** IntPtr is now a numeric type. This means that you can use it in arithmetic expressions and in comparisons.
* **Ref fields and scoped ref:** Ref fields and scoped ref allow you to declare fields and variables that are references to other objects. This can be useful for passing objects by reference or for storing references to objects that are expensive to create.
* **Improved method group conversion to delegate:** The conversion of method groups to delegates has been improved. This can make it easier to use method groups in asynchronous programming.
* **Warning wave 7:** Warning wave 7 introduces new warnings for potential errors and potential improvements in your code.

These are just some of the major features of C# 11.0. C# has continued to evolve over the years, and it now has many more features. However, these are the basic features that make C# a powerful and versatile programming language.

I hope this helps!
