Sure, here are some of the major features of C# 12.0:

* **Primary constructors:** Primary constructors are now available for non-record classes and structs. This allows you to add parameters to the class or struct declaration itself, and use those parameters to initialize the fields of the class or struct.
* **Optional parameters in lambda expressions:** You can now specify optional parameters in lambda expressions. This can make your code more concise and flexible.
* **Alias any type:** You can now use the `alias` keyword to alias any type. This can be useful for creating semantic aliases for types, or for working with types that are not yet defined.
* **Inline arrays:** You can now inline arrays in expressions. This can make your code more concise and efficient.
* **Interceptors:** Interceptors are a new feature that allows you to intercept and modify the execution of code. This can be useful for debugging, tracing, and performance optimization.

These are just some of the major features of C# 12.0. C# has continued to evolve over the years, and it now has many more features. However, these are the basic features that make C# a powerful and versatile programming language.
