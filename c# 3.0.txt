Sure, here are some of the major features of C# 3.0:

* **LINQ:** LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) is a set of features that allow you to query data in a more concise and expressive way.
* **Object and collection initializers:** Object and collection initializers allow you to initialize objects and collections in a more concise way.
* **Automatic properties:** Automatic properties allow you to create properties that are automatically implemented by the compiler.
* **Anonymous types:** Anonymous types allow you to create temporary objects without having to declare a class.
* **Lambda expressions:** Lambda expressions allow you to create anonymous functions that can be used to simplify code.
* **Expression trees:** Expression trees allow you to represent expressions as data structures. This can be useful for code optimization and debugging.
* **Partial methods:** Partial methods allow you to split a method into multiple parts. This can be useful for large methods or methods that are being developed by multiple people.
* **Extension methods:** Extension methods allow you to add new methods to existing types. This can be useful for making code more concise and reusable.

These are just some of the major features of C# 3.0. C# has continued to evolve over the years, and it now has many more features. However, these are the basic features that make C# a powerful and versatile programming language.

I hope this helps!
