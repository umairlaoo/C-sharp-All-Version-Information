Sure, here are some of the major features of C# 4.0:

* **Dynamic language features:** C# 4.0 introduced the `dynamic` keyword, which allows you to create dynamic objects and use them in expressions. This can be useful for working with scripting languages or APIs that are not fully .NET compliant.
* **Asynchronous programming:** C# 4.0 introduced asynchronous programming support, which allows you to write code that runs in the background without blocking the main thread. This can be useful for tasks that take a long time to complete, such as reading from a file or connecting to a database.
* **Nullable types:** C# 4.0 introduced nullable types, which allow you to represent values that can be null. This can be useful for handling data that may be missing or invalid.
* **Lambda expressions:** C# 4.0 improved lambda expressions, making them more concise and powerful.
* **Named arguments:** C# 4.0 introduced named arguments, which allow you to specify the names of the arguments when you call a method. This can make your code more readable and maintainable.
* **Optional parameters:** C# 4.0 introduced optional parameters, which allow you to specify default values for parameters when you call a method. This can make your code more flexible and concise.
* **Indexed properties:** C# 4.0 introduced indexed properties, which allow you to access properties by index. This can be useful for working with collections and arrays.

These are just some of the major features of C# 4.0. C# has continued to evolve over the years, and it now has many more features. However, these are the basic features that make C# a powerful and versatile programming language.
