Sure, here are some of the major features of C# 7.0:

* **Pattern matching:** Pattern matching allows you to match the shape of an object and take different actions depending on the match. This can be useful for conditional logic and data validation.
* **Tuples:** Tuples allow you to return multiple values from a function or method. This can be useful for grouping related data together.
* **Nullable reference types:** Nullable reference types allow you to represent values that can be null. This can be useful for handling data that may be missing or invalid.
* **Interpolated strings:** Interpolated strings allow you to insert expressions into strings. This can be useful for formatting strings and making them more readable.
* **Static classes:** Static classes allow you to create classes that do not have any instances. This can be useful for creating utility classes or classes that are only used for their static members.
* **Default interface methods:** Default interface methods allow you to provide default implementations for methods in an interface. This can make it easier to implement interfaces and avoid code duplication.
* **Recursive generic types:** Recursive generic types allow you to create generic types that can contain themselves. This can be useful for creating data structures that can be nested.
* **Implicitly typed local variables:** Implicitly typed local variables allow you to declare local variables without specifying their type. This can make your code more concise and readable.
* **Global using directives:** Global using directives allow you to import namespaces into all files in a project. This can make your code more readable and avoid repetition.
* **Asynchronous streams:** Asynchronous streams allow you to read and write data from and to streams asynchronously. This can be useful for handling large amounts of data or for performing tasks that take a long time to complete.

These are just some of the major features of C# 7.0. C# has continued to evolve over the years, and it now has many more features. However, these are the basic features that make C# a powerful and versatile programming language.

I hope this helps!
