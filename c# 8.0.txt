Certainly! C# 8.0 brought several new features and improvements to the language. Some of the key features introduced in C# 8.0 include:

1. **Nullable Reference Types:** This feature helps prevent null reference exceptions by allowing you to differentiate between nullable and non-nullable reference types. It helps catch potential null reference issues during compile-time and provides better safety.

2. **Async Streams:** C# 8.0 introduced the `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` interface, which allows you to work with asynchronous streams of data. This is particularly useful for scenarios where you want to produce asynchronous sequences of data.

3. **Default Interface Methods:** With this feature, you can define default implementations for methods in interfaces. This allows you to extend interfaces without breaking existing implementations and provides a way to add new methods to interfaces in a backward-compatible manner.

4. **Indices and Ranges:** This feature introduces a more concise and expressive way to work with ranges and indices within arrays and collections. You can use indexing syntax like `array[2..5]` to slice arrays and retrieve ranges of elements.

5. **Pattern Matching Enhancements:** C# 8.0 expanded pattern matching to include more expressive patterns, including switch expressions. This allows for more powerful and compact code when working with complex data structures.

6. **Using Declarations:** The `using` statement was enhanced to support "using declarations," which provide a more concise syntax for declaring disposable resources. This helps reduce the indentation level of code blocks.

7. **Static Local Functions:** C# 8.0 introduced the ability to declare local functions as `static`, which can improve performance by avoiding the allocation of a closure object when the function doesn't capture any variables from its containing scope.

8. **Readonly Members:** You can mark individual fields as `readonly` to ensure that they are only assigned a value during object initialization or within a constructor. This enforces immutability and can help prevent unintended modifications.

9. **Null-Coalescing Assignment:** The `??=` operator allows you to assign a value to a variable if it's currently `null`, providing a more concise way to set default values.

10. **Unmanaged Generic Structs:** C# 8.0 introduced support for unmanaged generic structs, which can be used to work with unmanaged types in a generic context. This is useful for scenarios like low-level memory manipulation.

These are some of the significant features introduced in C# 8.0. Each of these features aimed to improve the expressiveness, safety, and productivity of the language by addressing common programming challenges.
